An experiment in using Git and a scraping script as a way to archive a website as it changes.

This repository tracks revisions of the https://www.christiandailyreporter.com homepage. It is updated whenever I happen to run my scraper script and commit and push to the repository.

All scrapings are (c) Christian Daily Reporter. Consider this repository a historical archive or cache of that website. Think https://archive.org.
